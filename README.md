# BuildingGadgets2 GUI Mod

This is a mod to enhance schematics (templates) functionality by adding a gui to interact with the Bg2 Copy and Paste tool and within this mod gui you can save and load from disk. This way you can reuse schematics between worlds.

> NB: You need to have Bg2 installed, this mod does not replace Bg2!
